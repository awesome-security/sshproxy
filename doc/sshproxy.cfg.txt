NAME
----
sshproxy.cfg - sshproxy configuration file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*/etc/sshproxy.cfg*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*sshproxy*(8) reads its configuration from '/etc/sshproxy.cfg'. You can
specify another configuration as its first argument.

The configuration is in the TOML format, an enhanced version of INI (see
https://github.com/toml-lang/toml for details).

The following parameters can be defined:

*debug*::
	a boolean ('true' or 'false') to enable debug messages in the logs
	('false' by default).

*log*::
	a string which can be:
	- empty ('""') to display the logs on the standard output. It is the
	  default.
	- 'syslog' to save logs messages through the *syslog*(3).
	- a path to a filename. The directory must exist. The pattern '\{user}'
	  in the path will be replaced with the user login (eg.
	  '/var/log/sshproxy/\{user}.log'). The user is the owner of the
	  filename, so he needs the right to write in the specified directory.

*bg_command*::
	a string specifying a command which will be launched in the background
	for the session duration. Its standard and error outputs are only
	logged in debug mode. It is empty by default.

*route_choice*::
	a string specifying how the host destination will be chosen.  It can
	be 'ordered' (the default) or 'random'.  If 'ordered', the hosts are
	tried in the order listed until a successful connection is made.  The
	list is first randomly sorted if 'random' is specified (i.e. a
	poor-man load-balancing algorithm).

*dump*::
	a string specifying the path to save raw dumps for each user session.
	Empty by default. The path can (and should) contain one or more of the
	following patterns:
	- '\{user}' replaced by the user login
	- '\{sid}' replaced by the unique session id
	- '\{time}' replaced by the connection starting time (e.g.
	  "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00").
	The subdirectories will be created if needed with the user as owner.
	So the user needs to have the right to write in this directory.  For
	example: '/var/spool/sshproxy/\{user}/\{time}-\{sid}.dump'

*stats_interval*::
	a string specifying the interval at which basic statistics of
	transferred bytes are logged.  It is empty by default. The string can
	contain a unit suffix such as 'h', 'm' and 's' (e.g. '2m30s').

A table *environment* can be used to set environment variables. The pattern
'\{user}' will be replaced with the user login:

	[environment]
	XAUTHORITY = "/tmp/.Xauthority_{user}"

A table *routes* defines the destination according to the listening IP address
of the SSH daemon:

	[routes]
	192.168.0.1 = ["host1", "host2"]
	192.168.0.2 = ["host3", "host4"]
	default = ["host5:4222"]

Each key is a listening IP address of the SSH daemon and the values are a list
of destination hosts (with an optional port). The special key 'default' can be
used to define a default route. The hosts are tried in the order specified in
the previously defined 'route_choice' option.

In the previous example, a client connected to '192.168.0.1' will be proxied
to 'host1' and, if the host is not reachable, to 'host2'. If a client does not
connect to '192.168.0.1' or '192.168.0.2' it will be proxied to the sshd
daemon listening on port 4222 on 'host5'.

A table *ssh* specifies the SSH options:

*exe*::
	path or command to use for the SSH client ('ssh' by default).

*args*::
	a list of arguments for the SSH client. Its default value is: '["-q",
	"-Y"]'.

Each of the previous parameters can be overridden for a group thanks to a
*groups* sub-table.

For example if we want to save debug messages for the 'foo' group we define:

	[groups.foo]
	debug = true

To modify the routes, environment or SSH options we use another sub-table:

	[groups.foo.routes]
	default = ["hostx"]
	
	[groups.foo.ssh]
	args = ["-vvv", "-Y"]

The routes are fully overridden and not merged with previous defined ones.

If a user belongs to several groups and these groups are defined in the
configuration file, each setting can be overridden by the next group.

For example, if a user is in the 'admin' and 'users' groups the logs will be
in '/var/log/sshproxy/admin/\{user}.log' with the following configuration:

	[groups.users]
	log = /var/log/sshproxy/users/{user}.log
	
	[groups.admin]
	log = /var/log/sshproxy/admin/{user}.log

We can also override the parameters for a specific user with a 'users'
sub-table.

For example if we want to save debug messages for the 'foo' user we
define:

	[users.foo]
	debug = true

As for the groups, a sub-table is used to modify the routes, environment or SSH
options:

	[users.foo.ssh]
	args = ["-vvv", "-Y"]

The parameters defined for a user are the last applied and therefore always
override the settings defined by one or more 'groups' tables.
