NAME
----
sshproxy-managerd.yaml - sshproxy-managerd configuration file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*/etc/sshproxy/sshproxy-managerd.yaml*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*sshproxy-managerd*(8) reads its configuration from
'/etc/sshproxy/sshproxy-managerd.yaml'. You can specify another configuration
as its first argument.

The configuration is in the YAML format.

The following keys can be defined:

*debug*::
	a boolean ('true' or 'false') to enable debug messages in the logs
	('false' by default).

*listen*::
	a string specifying the listening address. The format is '[host]:port'
	and the default is '127.0.0.1:55555'.

*log*::
	a string which can be:
	- empty ('""') to display the logs on the standard output. It is the
	  default.
	- 'syslog' to save logs messages through the *syslog*(3).
	- a path to a filename.

*check_interval*::
	a string specifying the minimal interval for checking if an host is
	alive.  It is empty by default (i.e. always check host). The string
	can contain a unit suffix such as 'h', 'm' and 's' (e.g. '2m30s').

*route_select*::
	a string specifying how the host destination will be chosen.  It can
	be 'ordered' (the default) or 'random'.  If 'ordered', the hosts are
	tried in the order listed until a successful connection is made.  The
	list is first randomly sorted if 'random' is specified (i.e. a
	poor-man load-balancing algorithm).

An associative array *routes* defines the destination according to the
listening IP address of the SSH daemon:

	routes:
	    192.168.0.1: [host1, host2]
	    192.168.0.2: [host3, host4]
	    default: ["host5:4222"]

Each key is a listening IP address of the SSH daemon and the values are a list
of destination hosts (with an optional port). The special key 'default' can be
used to define a default route. The hosts are tried in the order specified in
the previously defined 'route_select' option.

Routes and route selection algorithm can be overridden for a Unix group of
users or a specified user with the *groups* and *users* associative arrays.

The routes are fully overridden and not merged with previous defined ones.

If a user is in multiple groups and these groups are defined in the
configuration, the configuration of a previous group will be overridden by the
next ones.

The parameters defined in the *users* associative array will be applied last
and override groups parameters.

For example if we want to always redirect members of the 'foo' group to
'hostx':

	groups:
	    foo:
	        default: [hostx]
