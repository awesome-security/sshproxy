NAME
----
sshproxy-managerd - manages routing decisions for sshproxy

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sshproxy-managerd* ['OPTIONS'] ['config']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

'sshproxy-managerd' is used with *sshproxy*(8) to choose the best destination
for a user connection. It keeps tracks of already established connections and
periodically checks if an host is alive.

OPTIONS
-------

*-version*::
	Show version number and exit.

PROTOCOL
--------

'sshproxy-managerd' implements a simple text protocol based on the Redis
protocol (http://redis.io/topics/protocol):

- all commands and responses are terminated with CRLF
- the client sends an ASCII command
- the server ASCII response begins with:
* '+' followed by a string for simple strings (e.g. `+OK\r\n`)
* '-' followed by an error message in case of error (e.g. `-ERR bad
  value\r\n`)
* '$' for bulk strings (i.e. strings with CRLF, NULL byte(s) or binary data):
+
--
** the '$' is followed by the number of bytes of the string terminated with
   CRLF
** the string itself
** the mandatory CRLF

For example: `$6\r\nHELLO!\r\n` (which could also be sent as `+HELLO!\r\n`).

A bulk string can also be used to represent a NULL value when the length is
-1: `$-1\r\n`.
--

The following commands can be sent to the listening port:

*connect user host:port*::
	Asks for a destination when the 'user' is connected to 'host:port'. It
	answers with `+host:port`, an empty string `+` or an error message.

*disable host:port*::
	Disables a host. A disabled host will not be proposed as a
	destination. The only way to enable it again is to send the 'enable'
	command. It could be used for host maintenance. It answers `+OK` or an
	error message.

*disconnect user host:port*::
	Tells that the 'user' is going to be disconnected to 'host:port'.
	It answers `+OK` or an error message.

*enable host:port*::
	Enables a destination if it was previously disabled with the 'disable'
	command. It answers `+OK` or an error message.

*failure host:port*::
	Tells that the 'host:port' is unavailable. It will verify if the host
	is unreachable and clears its cache if it is the case. It answers
	`+OK` or an error message.

*info <connections|checks>*::
	It returns a bulk string with current internal connections or checks,
	or an error message.
