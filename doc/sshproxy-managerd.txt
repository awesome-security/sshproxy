NAME
----
sshproxy-managerd - manages routing decisions for sshproxy

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sshproxy-managerd* ['OPTIONS'] ['config']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

'sshproxy-managerd' is used with *sshproxy*(8) to choose the best destination
for a user connection. It keeps tracks of already established connections and
periodically checks if an host is alive.

OPTIONS
-------

*-version*::
	Show version number and exit.

PROTOCOL
--------

'sshproxy-managerd' implements a simple text protocol. The following commands
can be sent to the listening port, followed by a '\r\n':

*connect user host:port*::
	Asks for a destination when the 'user' is connected to 'host:port'. It
	answers with an 'host:port' or closes the connection.

*disable host:port*::
	Disables a host. A disabled host will not be proposed as a
	destination. The only way to enable it again is to send the 'enable'
	command. It could be used for host maintenance. There is no answer.

*disconnect user host:port*::
	Tells that the 'user' is going to be disconnected to 'host:port'.
	There is no answer.

*enable host:port*::
	Enables a destination if it was previously disabled with the 'disable'
	command. There is no answer.

*failure host:port*::
	Tells that the 'host:port' is unavailable. There is no answer. It will
	verify if the host is unreachable and clears its cache if it is the
	case.

*info <connections|checks>*::
	Displays current internal connections or checks.

FILES
-----
/etc/sshproxy/sshproxy-managerd.yaml::
	Contains configuration (see *sshproxy-managerd.yaml*(5) for details).
