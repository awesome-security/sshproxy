# Listen address.
# The format is [host]:port. The default is 127.0.0.1:55555.

# Default is empty (and logs are written on stdout) but it can either be
# "syslog" if you want to use syslog or a filename.

# Minimum interval for checking if an host is alive.

# How the host destination will be chosen. It can be "ordered" (the default) or
# "random". If "ordered", the hosts are tried in the order listed until a
# successful connection is made. The list is first randomly sorted if "random"
# is specified (i.e. a poor-man load-balancing algorithm).

# Routes definition.
# The key is the IP address of the listening SSH daemon and the value is an
# array of destination hosts (with an optional port). The special key "default"
# can be used to define a default route. The hosts are tried in the order
# specified in the previously defined "route_select" option.
#routes:
#    192.168.0.1: [host1, host2]
#    192.168.0.2: [host3, host4]
#    default: ["host5:4222"]

# Routes and route selection algorithm can be overridden for a Unix group of
# users or a specified user with the groups and users associative arrays.
# The routes are fully overridden and not merged with previous defined ones.
# If a user is in multiple groups and these groups are defined in the
# configuration, the configuration of a previous group will be overridden by the
# next ones.
# The parameters defined in the "users" associative array will be applied last
# and override groups parameters.
#groups:
#    foo:
#        route_select: random
#        routes:
#            default: [hostx]
